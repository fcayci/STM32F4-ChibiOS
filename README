** ChibiProjects **
*******************

My ChibiOS/RT projects running mostly on STM32F4 Discovery board and my STM32F405RG based custom quadcopter board.

*******************
** HOW TO SETUP  **
*******************

* Get GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors from [https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded]. Pre-build ones should be fine. Extract it to some directory and add it to your PATH variable. Make sure there is no spaces in the directory path.
* Checkout ChibiOS/RT from [https://github.com/mabl/ChibiOS]
* Checkout ChibiProjects. Place them (ChibiOS/RT and ChibiProjects) under the same directory.
* Browse into one of the projects and execute 'make clean && make'. If it all goes well, you should see a 'Done' message at the end.
* Get Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers, and set it up according to ChibiOS pages from [http://www.chibios.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=chibios:guides:eclipse1] and [http://www.chibios.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=chibios:guides:eclipse2]. The most important section is 'Preparing your Workspace'.
* For debugging get either stlink from [https://github.com/texane/stlink] or openocd to flash the board. You can also use [https://github.com/ArchMage/stm32loader] to flash your board using bootloader over USART port.

* st-flash usage from a project directory:
'st-flash write build/ch.bin 0x08000000'

* st-flash arguments for eclipse:
'write ${selected_resource_loc}/build/ch.bin 0x08000000'
